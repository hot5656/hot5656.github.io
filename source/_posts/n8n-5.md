# Lovable ptompt
Create an AI-powered image generator app. The interface should be clean, modern, and visually appealing. Users should be able to type in a description of the image they want and click a button to generate it.
To generate the image, send a POST request to this endpoint: https://hot5656.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/image
The request body should look like this:
{ "prompt": "a high-resolution portrait of a man wearing a suit" }
The API will return the generated image as a binary file.

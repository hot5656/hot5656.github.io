### C
#### VSCode debug
1. Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio:
 + Open the "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio" from the Start menu. This sets up the necessary environment variables for Visual C++ development.
2. Start Visual Studio Code from Developer Command Prompt:
 + After opening the Developer Command Prompt, navigate to your project directory using the cd command.
 + Launch Visual Studio Code from this command prompt:
 ``` bash
 code .
 ```
 This ensures that Visual Studio Code inherits the environment variables set up by the Developer Command Prompt.
3. Configure Environment Variables in Visual Studio Code:
 + In Visual Studio Code, you can configure environment variables in the .vscode/settings.json file.
 + Open the settings.json file by clicking on the gear icon in the lower-left corner and selecting "Settings."
 + Click on the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top-right corner.
 + Add or modify the "env" settings to include the necessary paths. For example:
 ``` json
 {
    "env": {
        "PATH": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.29.30133\\bin\\Hostx64\\x64"
    }
 }
 ```
 Make sure to adjust the path to match your Visual Studio installation.
4. Install the C/C++ Extension:
 + Make sure you have the "C/C++" extension installed in Visual Studio Code. This extension provides IntelliSense, debugging, and build support for C and C++ languages.
5. Verify Compiler Path:
 + In your Visual Studio Code project, create or check the .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json file to ensure the correct path to the compiler is set. For example:
 ``` json
 {
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Win32",
            "includePath": ["${workspaceFolder}/**"],
            "defines": ["_DEBUG", "UNICODE", "_UNICODE"],
            "compilerPath": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.29.30133/bin/Hostx64/x64/cl.exe",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "intelliSenseMode": "msvc-x64"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
Adjust the compilerPath according to your Visual Studio installation.
After these steps, you should be able to build and debug your C++ code within Visual Studio Code, and it should recognize the compiler and tools from your Visual Studio installation.

#### remove a PATH from this cmd
``` bash
set PATH=%PATH:C:\cygwin64\bin;=%
```

#### build cs50 lib and link by local
``` c
// hello.c
# include "cs50.h"
# include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
	// printf("hello, world");

	string answer = get_string("What's your name?");
	printf("hello answer");
}
```

``` bash
# build static library
gcc -shared -o cs50lib.dll cs50.c 

# build hello.c and link library
gcc -o hello.exe .\hello.c -L. -lcs50lib
```

#### Valgrind 
Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

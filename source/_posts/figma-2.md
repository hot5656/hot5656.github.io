a serif font for headings, a sans-serif font for body text

+ Noto Sans (思源黑體): This is a sans-serif font developed by Google that supports a wide range of languages, including Traditional Chinese. It has a clear and legible design, making it a good choice for body text.
+ Microsoft JhengHei (微軟正黑體): This is a sans-serif font developed by Microsoft specifically for Traditional Chinese. It has a modern and stylish design, and is widely used in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
+ Adobe Heiti (Adobe 黑体): This is a sans-serif font developed by Adobe that supports Traditional Chinese. It has a simple and elegant design, making it a good choice for both headings and body text.

#### font, size, and weight 
+ H1: For the main heading, use a bold font that is easy to read at a larger size. A font size of around 36px-48px is appropriate, depending on the design.
+ H2: For subheadings, use a slightly smaller font size and a lighter weight than the H1. A font size of around 24px-36px should work well.
+ H3-H6: For lower-level headings, use a smaller font size and a lighter weight than the previous headings. A font size of around 16px-24px is appropriate, depending on the design.
+ Body large: For larger body text, use a font size of around 18px-24px with a regular or medium weight. A sans-serif font such as Microsoft JhengHei, PingFang, or Noto Sans should work well.
+ Body regular: For regular body text, use a font size of around 14px-16px with a regular or medium weight. Again, a sans-serif font is recommended.
+ Body small: For smaller body text such as captions or footnotes, use a font size of around 12px-14px with a regular or light weight.
+ Paragraph: Use a line height of around 1.5-2.0 times the font size for all text elements to ensure readability. Also, be sure to use plenty of whitespace between paragraphs to help break up the text and make it easier to read.

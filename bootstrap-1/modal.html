						<p>What follows is just some placeholder text for this modal dialog. Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun,
							coming up all lazy. It’s in the palm of your hand now baby. So we hit the boulevard. So make a wish, I'll
							make it like your birthday everyday. Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under? It's time to
							bring out the big balloons. You could've been the greatest. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Your kiss
							is cosmic, every move is magic.</p>

							is like a drug. Always leaves a trail of stardust. The girl's a freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna Beach.
							Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. All my girls vintage Chanel baby.</p>
						<p>Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares.
							This is no big deal. Calling out my name. I could have rewrite your addiction. She's got that, je ne sais
							quoi, you know it. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. 'Cause, baby, you're a firework. Like thunder
							gonna shake the ground.</p>
						<p>Just own the night like the 4th of July! I’m gon’ put her in a coma. What you're waiting for, it's time
							for you to show it off. Can't replace you with a million rings. You open my eyes and I'm ready to go, lead
							me into the light. And here you are. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Come on, let your colours burst. So cover
							your eyes, I have a surprise. As I march alone to a different beat. Glitter all over the room pink
							flamingos in the pool.</p>
						<p>You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine! Come just as you are to me. Just own the night like the
							4th of July. Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison. Come just as you are to me. End of the
							rainbow looking treasure.</p>
						<p>I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. I can't sleep let's run away
							and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up
							above. I'm walking on air (tonight). Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans. Stinging like a
							bee I earned my stripes. I went from zero, to my own hero. Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon. Make
							'em go, 'Aah, aah, aah' as you shoot across the sky-y-y! Why don't you let me stop by?</p>
						<p>Boom, boom, boom. Never made me blink one time. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. Talk about our
							future like we had a clue. Oh my God no exaggeration. You're original, cannot be replaced. The girl's a
							freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna Beach. It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal. In another
							life I would make you stay. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. I wanna walk on your wave
							length and be there when you vibrate Never made me blink one time.</p>
						<p>We'd keep all our promises be us against the world. If you get the chance you better keep her. It's time
							to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons. I hope you got a healthy appetite. Don't let the
							greatness get you down, oh, oh yeah. Yeah, she's footloose and so fancy free. I want the jaw droppin', eye
							poppin', head turnin', body shockin'. End of the rainbow looking treasure.</p>
